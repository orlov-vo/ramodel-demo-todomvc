# TodoMVC demo created with RaModel and µhtml

Demo for showing [RaModel](https://github.com/orlov-vo/ramodel) in the battle. For rendering the layout I used very tiny and fast [µhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/uhtml).

You can see the demo in [Netlify](https://ramodel-demo-todomvc.netlify.app/)

It's part of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)
